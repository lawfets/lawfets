- Hi, I’m @lawfets
- I’m interested in all different kinds of programming languages
- I have basic knowledge of all languages that follow but I'm restarting as it has been a while since I learned them.
- I’m currently learning PHP and MySQL.  
- Really interested in computer repair, laptop repair and computer electronics.
- Trying to gather more and more motherboards or broken laptops/pc's to have spare parts for repairs.
