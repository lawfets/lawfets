- Hi, I’m @lawfets
- I’m interested in all different kinds of programming languages
- I have basic knowledge of all languages that follow but I'm restarting as it has been a while since I learned them.
- I’m currently learning with freecodecamp. HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT - SQL
- In the future, I'll be expanding on PHP - PYTHON. (Although not advised)
- I’m looking to collaborate on something that interests me, not yet searched for.
