- Hi, I’m @lawfets
- I’m interested in all different kinds of programming languages
- I have basic knowledge of all languages that follow but I'm restarting as it has been a while since I learned them.
- I’m currently learning Javascript, PHP and MySQL.  
  
I seem to be doing more commits at the moment because I'm testing out git and github.  
Seems like I still have some stuff to learn about committing and pushing and pulling.
